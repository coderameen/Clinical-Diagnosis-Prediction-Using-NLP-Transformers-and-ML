Accurate diagnosis is vital for effective treatment, yet much clinical data exists in unstructured forms such as notes and summaries, making it difficult to analyze with traditional methods. Manual interpretation is slow, error-prone, and dependent on clinician availability. This project fine-tunes the Hugging Face BERT model to process clinical text and predict medical diagnoses. By leveraging NLP for diagnosis prediction, the work aims to reduce errors, support faster decision-making, and enhance patient care through AI-powered clinical decision support systems.
